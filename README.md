Module 4 - Data analysis with Pandas

PyCitySchool

For this challenge, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data using the datasets in schools__complete.csv and students_complete.csv.

The script analyzes the district-wide standardized test results and then aggregates the data to showcase the following:

1. DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school:
* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

2. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

3. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

4. Math Scores by Grade (i.e., 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grades)

5. Reading Scores by Grade (i.e., 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grades)

6. Scores by School Spending (by bins: <$585, $585-630, $630-645, $645-680]

7. Scores by School Size (by Small (<1000), Medium (1000-2000), Large (2000-5000)

8. Scores by School Type (by Charter or District type)

RESOURCES AND REFERENCES

During the challenge I referenced the following to aid in the understanding and completion of the assignment:

Reviewed all the class activites in GitLab Working Folder - reperforming a majority of them

Watched the following Dr. A instructor videos:

Variables in Python
If Statements in Python
If / Else Statements in Python
If / Else If Statements in Python
While Loops in Python (Part 1)
While Loops in Python (Part 2)
While Loops in Python (Part 3) Running Totals

I used google to search for additional references to further understand the following:

How to access CSV file using OS module
Understanding the different Python numbers
Understanding the Python int() Function
Understanding use of Escape Characters
Understanding Python next() Function
Understanding Python list() Function
I also used the following codes as references for performing my assignment. Specifically, I would review both codes and gain an understanding of their organization. I would then incorporate my knowledge and practice from the class activities, instructor videos, and independent research to write my scripts for both PyBank and PyPoll.
