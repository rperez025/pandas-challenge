Module 4 - Data analysis with Pandas

PyBank

For this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company using the dataset in budget_data_(RP).csv, which included a column for "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The script analyzes the records and calculated the following:

Total number of months included in the dataset
Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes
Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll

For this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the voting data using the dataset in election_data_(RP).csv, which included three columns for "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

The script analyzes the votes and calculated the following:

Total number of votes cast
Complete list of candidates who received votes
Percentage of votes each candidate won
Total number of votes each candidate won
Winner of the election based on popular vote

RESOURCES AND REFERENCES

During the challenge I referenced the following to aid in the understanding and completion of the assignment:

Reviewed all the class activites in GitLab Working Folder - reperforming a majority of them

Watched the following Dr. A instructor videos:

Variables in Python
If Statements in Python
If / Else Statements in Python
If / Else If Statements in Python
While Loops in Python (Part 1)
While Loops in Python (Part 2)
While Loops in Python (Part 3) Running Totals
For Loops in Python (Part 1)
For Loops in Python (Part 2)
For Loops in Python (Part 3)
I used google to search for additional references to further understand the following:

How to access CSV file using OS module
Understanding the different Python numbers
Understanding the Python int() Function
Understanding use of Escape Characters
Understanding Python next() Function
Understanding Python list() Function
I also used the following codes as references for performing my assignment. Specifically, I would review both codes and gain an understanding of their organization. I would then incorporate my knowledge and practice from the class activities, instructor videos, and independent research to write my scripts for both PyBank and PyPoll.
