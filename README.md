#Module 4 - Data analysis with Pandas

**PyCitySchool**

For this challenge, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data using the datasets in schools__complete.csv and students_complete.csv.

The script analyzes the district-wide standardized test results and then aggregates the data to showcase the following:

1. DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school:
* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

2. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

3. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

4. Math Scores by Grade (i.e., 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grades)

5. Reading Scores by Grade (i.e., 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grades)

6. Scores by School Spending (by bins: <$585, $585-630, $630-645, $645-680]

7. Scores by School Size (by Small (<1000), Medium (1000-2000), Large (2000-5000)

8. Scores by School Type (by Charter or District type)

**RESOURCES AND REFERENCES**

During the challenge I referenced the following to aid in the understanding and completion of the assignment:

1. Reviewed all the class activites in GitLab Working Folder - reperforming a majority of them

2. Watched the following Dr. A instructor videos:
* [Pandas Day 01 Activity #09 - Reading and Writing CSV Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2sqH4pWzxI)
* [Pandas Day 01 - Activity #10 and #11- Comic Books (Part 1 and 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1LhPnlvHFc)
* [Pandas Day 02 - Activity 06 - GroupBy Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tETt55I-VHY)
* [Pandas Day 02 - Activity 07 - Exploring Census Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zRMuPKyJBw)
* [Pandas Day 02 - Activity 08 - Pandas Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOy5NZ8331k)
* [Pandas Day 02 - Activity 09 - Search For The Worst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLofW8YAKok)

3. I also used the following code as reference for performing my assignment. Specifically, I would review both codes and gain an understanding of their organization and use. I would then incorporate my knowledge and practice from the class activities and instructor videos to write my script for the PyCitySchoolsAnalysis_RP.ipynb.
